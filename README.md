## Juho Viljamaa and Sami Vapola
This repository contains the excercise project done during course "Programming 3" (TIE-02402). The "Course" submodule's code was provided by course staff. This project received a grade of 5.

The subject of the course project was to design and implement a board game (dubbed as "Colonizing Pirkanmaa" by course staff). There were not many strict requirements for the game, instead the students were to design most of the game themselves.
